### Hi Nerds ðŸ‘‹


I code on occasion, believe it or not. My latest deal is I'm making as many useful things with React and Next.js _as humanly possible_. I also have some non-coding things that I update on occasion, for example my [talks](https://github.com/cassidoo/talks) repo.

I love jokes and musicals. Also candy. I work at [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/r1x64k41v), too. If you would like to discuss these things, you can join my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cassidoo) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cassidoo). You can also [ask me anything](https://github.com/cassidoo/ama) (within reason).
